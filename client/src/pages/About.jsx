          This project was created using React and Bootstrap 5. The banner on the
          homepage will generate a random item from the shop everytime querying
          the JSON data. The shopping cart is accessible from the whole site using
          React Context. Items added to the cart are stored in local storage so
          even if you refresh the page, they are still there. The cart will
          calculate the total price and allow to to remove items from it. The
          store page will also allow you to add and remove items from the cart.
          Overall this was a really fun project and great learning experience.
